    skos:definition """The World Wide Web Consortium's vision of an Internet-based web of Linked Data.

Semantic Web is used to refer to something more than just the technologies and conventions of Linked Data; the term also encompases a specific set of interoperable data models - often called ontologies - published by the W3C, other standards bodies and some well-known companies.

The 'semantic' refers to the strongly-defined nature of the elements in the Semantic Web: the meaning of Semantic Web data is as precicely defined as any data can be."""@en ;
