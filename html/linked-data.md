A set of technologies and conventions defined by the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/) that aim to present data in both human- and machine-readable form over the Internet.

Linked Data is strongly-defined with each element having either a local definition or a link to an available definition on the Internet.

Linked Data is graph-based in nature, that is it consistes of nodes and edges that can forever be linked to further conceps with defined relationships.
