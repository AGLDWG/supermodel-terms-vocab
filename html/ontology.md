In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse.

The word ontology was originally defined as "the branch of philosophy that studies concepts such as existence, being, becoming, and reality". and the computer science term is derived from that definition.
