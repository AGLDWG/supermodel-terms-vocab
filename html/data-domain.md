[Scope Note](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#scopeNote) | Data Domains are not themed at a level above science domains or domains within other, particular, diciplines but are instead based on parts of measurement models, such as the Observations & Measurement ISO19156<sup>1</sup> standard. This is to ensure that the domains are relevant to many forms of data, given that data is often measured and observed.
